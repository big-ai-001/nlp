0
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,760
You can't have a little bit of a problem

00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:23,550
Singer?

4
00:00:48,130 --> 00:01:04,650
Okay, um, before we go, ah, I'm going to discuss with you about active learning, right?

5
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:07,650
Yeah, if you've been, I presumes that, uh, you have a lady.

6
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:15,270

Um, alex, have you watched the video?

22
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:15,440
No. Why do you understand that?

23
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:21,220
Um, we have the video, but if anyone wanted to answer this question, shall we talk?

24
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:30,900
Okay, whether this is, what? Wait, wait a minute, or surpass the microphone today.

25
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:40,630
Okay, jump in talk. I want you to raise your hands by yourself.

26
00:03:46,830 --> 00:04:00,290
Wait. All right. Um. Talking tom is a traditional way to teach students, and students have a real motivation to get involved in class.

27
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:05,230
Okay, yeah. Oh, what is the matter?

28
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:14,680
Chuck? Trouble is Echo Right. Okay, children Toy.

29
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:17,800
Yeah. So it said it's a traditional way, right?

30
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:21,750
And he said that students got no motivation.

31
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:26,110
Um, anyone wanted to add something about no motivation here?

32
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:29,660
You said to children, talk by using traditional chalk.

33
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:34,010
Right? There's a chairman talk. so I am the instructor, right?

34
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:37,030
I use a chalk and talk to get away.

35
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:39,450
And River said, there's no motivation.

36
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:43,850
What's that? 21. One, two. Answer this team.

37
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:46,370
Have you watched the video? Yeah.

38
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:50,190
Okay. Can you add something? Why says no motivation?

39
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:57,090
What does it mean? And would you want to add something?

40
00:04:57,710 --> 00:04:59,470
Would you want to answer this?

41
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:04,730
Yeah. The same question is a traditional way.

42
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:07,080
Yeah. Is this a strategy student way?

43
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,100
A test megaphone

44
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:15,710
here? Okay, I can see that.

45
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:19,110
So if you want to answer, that's I'm with you.

46
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,670
Yeah, it can.

47
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:39,360
But now a formal method of teaching in which the focal point are the big ball are the teaching.

48
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:46,250
Voice Voice MHM And what we also said is just no balibation.

49
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:49,950
You understand that? No. Okay. Thank you.

50
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:53,400
Um. What's only here? Teachers. Boys.

51
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:59,240
MR That okay, um, yes, only Teacher.

52
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,220
Right. Then another team I volunteer students.

53
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:11,240
I'm no Motivation. Hello. Oh yeah.

54
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:15,800
Motivation is don G-U is. And why?

55
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:23,040
Student did have motivation? Because your talk show is a pathway to learning.

56
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:30,070
If you after learning, you will want to get more knowledge.

57
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:34,260
Uh, is more. Have have more motivation in this class.

58
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:40,720
Thank you. Okay, good. So team said that, uh, I mentioned that I keep learning, right?

59
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,820
So try and talk chopin talk.

60
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:50,180
And students have no motivation. And after learning, students wanted to learn more.

61
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:53,890
And I got the the driver.

62
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:57,590
You know, you have your internal driver, wanted to learn more.

63
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:00,390
That is a kind of motivation.

64
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:08,340
Something stimulates your thinking, right? Then it's going to respond that you need something eagerly.

65
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:14,760
That is the motivation. You need something eagerly, but yourself, that is the motivation.

66
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,800
E.g. you're hungry, you know, you want to eat, right?

67
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:23,040
Or, uh, you need to know something.

68
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,980
This is very interesting, like that.

69
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:30,240
You need to see that you have a drive internal driver, right?

70
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,100
That's kind of motivation, right? Alex, right.

71
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:39,840
Process on to addicts. Would you answer the 2nd question?

72
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:45,630
Similar in countries? What do you understand about some the concept active learning?

73
00:07:55,510 --> 00:08:07,310
I'm gonna be really honest. I didn't watch the video, but I have learned the terms of active learning before, and it's basically a way of the teaching in class to engage with students.

74
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:30,120
So instead of the old traditional method, you're using talking toll, where the teacher just basically explaining everything using chop and just explaining using talk, but we're trying to create a situation in the class where basically everyone's got involved in the terms of teaching, and get a chance to, um, what is it like express their opinions, their thoughts and their ideas towards the materials that's being taught in class?

75
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,260
Okay, so yeah, it's a pretty good right?

76
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:36,320
So at least that, uh, I keep learning.

77
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:44,100
Well, he he knew the idea before, but you didn't watch the video, right?

78
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:48,560
But okay, if you understand that it's actually running, right?

79
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,480
Student is that every student got a chance.

80
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,040
Said that every student got a chance.

81
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:58,400
But, you know, even an opportunity, but you probably, you know, have no way to talk, but you have the opportunity.

82
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,600
I give you everyone opportunity, right?

83
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:03,740
So student had opportunity to talk.

84
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:09,060
Right? Since the talk, they don't feel, they don't feel asleep, sleepy, right?

85
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:19,290
And they don't more. In words, if you can convey a concept I in public, you need to organize your thoughts logically, right?

86
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:26,140
So the more you have this platform, the more practice you have that can reach your understanding.

87
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:31,820
Right? So after learning everybody involved in in the course, right?

88
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:37,950
The best way can enhance your understanding of the topic that instructor design.

89
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:42,490
So this is the one that in contrast, or how do you understand the concept of active learning?

90
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:44,960
Active, you are not passive, right?

91
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:48,980
If it's a traditional way, you will passive, receive everything.

92
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:53,930
I thought. Right? Again, what is the role of teacher in happy learning?

93
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:55,890
What do you think about the role of teacher?

94
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:01,250
Jim OK Pass this on microphone.

95
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:08,630
Okay, thank you. All right, the gym

96
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:17,310
teacher. So on the road of the

97
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:23,920
teacher in art learning is more like the top leader, or the people gathering our opinion.

98
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,620
Okay, so get your students opinion.

99
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:29,270
Yes, there are teachers

100
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:32,680
on as a guide, right? You have a coach.

101
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:39,770
So the role of teacher, like coach, you know, coach like your personal trainer, right?

102
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:49,190
So I-I think that's, um, well, nowadays technology very advanced, right?

103
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:59,210
So we have the advanced technology, then you can get a change information, almost everything from the Internet.

104
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:06,220
All right, so with that situation, you think that you can get it?

105
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,530
You can get all the information, everything from the Internet.

106
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:12,750
How come you need to come to the classroom?

107
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:16,070
So teacher throw should be changed.

108
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:21,740
All right, so not just the knowledge transmitter become a problem.

109
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:28,320
Sober, problem. Sober. I say that you come here with your problem with question, right?

110
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:34,600
So you cannot get this kind of convenience um from the Internet.

111
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:39,160
You. You ask no one, but the teacher can answer that.

112
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:49,430
Of course teacher has done. Now, the burden you got to study, you know, every day, because you got to answer question, become the problem sober.

113
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,340
Oh, your problem will be different from others.

114
00:11:52,500 --> 00:12:04,240
All right. And since teacher are good at the topic, and he or she should have no the whole understanding, almost, right?

115
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:08,260
And progress with time, right? They can answer your question.

116
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:12,680
So become a problem. Sober, like a coach, the coach.

117
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:19,410
Your coach will be different from others, or the same coach will treat you both differently, right?

118
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:25,840
So there's a problem. Sober the year, the role of the teacher gathers students opinion.

119
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,520
Or, yeah, I would engage my listening to your opinion, you know, right?

120
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:45,550
So, even even though I'm familiar with some topic, but you have different kinds of problem, or your view points, they help me, you know, understand the level, or to what extent you have already understand this topic.

121
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:51,530
Then with that, then I can just my teaching strategy.

122
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:54,530
Okay, um. Those are role students.

123
00:12:54,820 --> 00:13:07,400
My teacher become a coach like guide my problems over by not just deliver the knowledge information, not just that, because you can get everything from the Internet.

124
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:10,170
What is your room? Students room.

125
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:17,410
What's going to answer this? Okay, david Right.

126
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:19,890
All right. Pass us on. Goods.

127
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:42,950
Uh. As a student, student should express that opinion or feedback to the professor, then the professor will now a student give challenge or question.

128
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:50,850
Okay, thank you. Right. So students, um, come here, um, not just a listen.

129
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:56,220
So when I keep, um, participates in a discussion, right?

130
00:13:56,380 --> 00:14:00,280
A students room in, excuse me to do a lot, right?

131
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:11,010
I said, that's, um, well, we have study roads, because in addition to come to the class, then I'm going to assign you in a discussion group, right?

132
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,090
And you need to share your knowledge.

133
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:19,850
Bye. So come here, not just the brink, everything, right?

134
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:24,710
So you bring everything, then you feel easy, you're not involved in in the course.

135
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:30,090
Right? Okay, so yeah, this, um, they summarize it.

136
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:35,230
Active learning is a kind of teaching methodology, right?

137
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:41,760
It is a new one, not that new, but it is hard to implement.

138
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:46,890
Because as a teacher, I need to prepare, right?

139
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:52,600
So I need to prepare based on students, no background.

140
00:14:52,760 --> 00:15:04,910
Then I want to design the course, and I want to design the task, because the test is going to help you understand that.

141
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:07,300
So you might discuss in a group, right?

142
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,190
So I such as, I sign you in group

143
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:16,480
and I ask questions and then follow the question to raise out a question.

144
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:25,120
Right? So it is hard for brain structure, and for you, also harder because you got to prepare right both ways.

145
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:30,430
But you know, the beauty, the beauty of this kind of teach, right, is that

146
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:35,110
even more right you try, right?

147
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:40,270
You have some driven, um, this stimulus.

148
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:49,290
Then you said that, I I'm going to to read that before you come, because no otherwise you cannot participate in the discussion.

149
00:15:50,880 --> 00:16:05,410
So yeah, that's explaining. It's hard to implement it, but we try, you know, they do that, but to enhance your comprehensions all around the course.

150
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:09,670
Okay, then the small bound to our chapter one.

151
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:21,890
Chapter one, right? It is an overview, because it's just beginning.

152
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:26,530
So the course, they give you the broad picture.

153
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:41,770
Right? So in this chapter, there are lots of issue, but I will not describe it in detail in 1 H We don't have enough time, right?

154
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:45,610
So there would be too big issue, right?

155
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:50,620
I wanted to focus on one is the STLC Right?

156
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:54,300
The 2nd one would be the methodology.

157
00:16:54,820 --> 00:17:01,900
Right? We also have other the issue that, um, you can read it by yourself.

158
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:10,370
Seven, let's see, still see, right?

159
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:14,710
So system did better payments, life cycle, right?

160
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:33,040
Still seeing short. Okay, so we need to understand that, um, a system give birth, the birth, and then grow and decline, even die.

161
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:39,060
By all can reverse, go to the beginning again.

162
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:52,050
When you go to the beginning again, it's not the same because probably it's already, um, this the 2nd version, or probably you fix some problem, make it better, I guess, suits water to your knees.

163
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:54,270
All right, so we left cycle.

164
00:17:54,430 --> 00:18:10,050
Um, in our textbook, we have four faces, but you may see other textbook of other resources divided into five, six, oh, seven.

165
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:13,850
So it doesn't matter about the number, right?

166
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:22,770
But they are similar, right? If, by somebody that subdivides a more, then becomes seven, right?

167
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:26,650
Or I put it in water like this.

168
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:32,520
So four faces the plane, the plane analysis, right?

169
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:38,500
So plan is a phase plan analysis, design and implementation by four phases.

170
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:47,970
Every face has its steps. So sad and activities.

171
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:53,770
And we need to know that when it's end, right?

172
00:18:54,190 --> 00:19:15,140
So the end we have some, it could be documents, it could be code rang We call this digital because that deliver tells us that at the end of this phase, we're going to go to the next phase, and next phase.

173
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:20,060
So it is an official project, right?

174
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:36,450
So that's going to have I review, yeah, you reach the the compressions of the task, that it is a deviable, then can review it.

175
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:38,950
Okay, then go to the next phase that.

176
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:47,270
That's right, and so we're going to talk about methodology, right?

177
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:51,530
So here you can read spell the role.

178
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:57,810
So system analyst, and a lot of a lot of member in a team by yourself.

179
00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:09,080
All right, we all have time to discuss the object of uentility, characteristic in detail.

180
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:14,020
I'm going to put data right today, we're not going to to talk about that.

181
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:15,340
And also, we

182
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:21,470
probably don't have enough time to to describe unify process, or U-P,

183
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:33,520
in short, unified process. Next week we also will describe the methodology or some processes, right?

184
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:36,390
Um. So we're going to touch that

185
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:49,860
again. The 1st ones are also give you key words, right?

186
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:56,240
So that help you on grasp the key issue, key feature of the contents?

187
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,140
Yeah, probably, I don't get that.

188
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:03,600
So, the formal process. So why do we need a formal process?

189
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:10,930
To answer this question, you need to understand what is normal, formal informal.

190
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:20,580
Right? So what is formal process when we talk about the words formal?

191
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:24,340
All right, so do you know that formal process?

192
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:32,940
Carbon from process. Why? What do you need from the process?

193
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:44,100
I'm just press What? Uh? It's a systematic way to solve problem.

194
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:54,810
Yes? Sub problem I was the difference between four more informal, a formal and normal formal and informal.

195
00:21:54,970 --> 00:22:04,520
A difference between formal, informal, uh, I think formal health a more document.

196
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:21,370
So the after you got, after you leave the department, or some or your organization, or the best people can maintenance, no system, OK?

197
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:26,190
So it's a former one who have a document around, somebody can follow the love.

198
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:31,430
So this is a formal When I talk about a year, is that what we need?

199
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:35,050
You have the formal process for somebody can't in a revise on.

200
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:45,330
And when, when we talk about four phases, all right, we talk about plan analysis, designs, implementation, this is a formal one in the process.

201
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:47,350
Okay, so that is a formal process.

202
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:50,440
Then we know that plain analysis photo.

203
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,480
That's right, we understand where we are.

204
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,580
Right? Okay, so formal, formal process.

205
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,740
What do we need? Formal process?

206
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:06,350
Kevin says that we can't help some No, some way like um, provide documentation that we can rely on.

207
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:08,840
We know that will will we write that?

208
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,040
That's why it's a formal process.

209
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:18,720
We know there's a prime practice, so we have a lot of activity, all right, and we know that.

210
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:26,080
And it's a formal process. So, um, and uh, without that, become informal.

211
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:31,900
Right? So informal, um, listen. Informal.

212
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:36,260
Okay, informal. So what is informally?

213
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:39,520
Um, can we design a system?

214
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:45,180
Yeah, doing Okay, in for a moment.

215
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:51,140
Let me give you a hunch.

216
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:57,120
In informal is not not the regular way.

217
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:07,200
Um, can we design a system by whatever you thought, based on your instinct?

218
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:13,710
You understand the question Formal informal.

219
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:20,170
It's probably hard to answer informal, informal way.

220
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:30,650
So if you don't follow follow the the phase, then all the photos, some matter does become informal.

221
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:34,470
I know this. This matter, it's hard to answer.

222
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:46,240
That's uh, informal. I mean, we design a system by you imagination, you are intuition, right?

223
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,840
That's informal, right? We cannot do that, right?

224
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:55,220
We cannot use this kind of measure to conduct the compressing project.

225
00:24:55,390 --> 00:24:57,670
That's yeah. Well, TB your name.

226
00:24:57,770 --> 00:25:02,490
Media Formal and Jiang Great function.

227
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:08,600
Large formal. Qi Long Woman Shit outside your washroom.

228
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:17,150
So she is a formal informal position mirror.

229
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:24,590
And would street intuition? Woman Design equal

230
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,750
the usual woman. We invite welcome

231
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,270
this kind of imagination.

232
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:37,050
Usual. That's basically your unique structure.

233
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:44,270
All right, so you should go the form

234
00:25:45,510 --> 00:26:01,320
Oh, you should informal thinking. All right, so it's why we need formal process, without any structure that we fail by often we don't even know the reason, right?

235
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:05,020
So by chance, I succeed, right?

236
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:10,650
Order, I cannot guarantee next time will be so lucky.

237
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:14,210
Right? So, yeah, that's for money for more, right?

238
00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:19,540
School system is not intuitive, not based on your intuition, right?

239
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:22,040
So I'm going to do that this way.

240
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,820
And next time, you know, I don't know.

241
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:33,290
Okay, so that is, um, that will we need for more than this planning analysis, design implementation.

242
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:39,930
Probably go to go back to the planning, but it was not the same.

243
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:46,130
All right, so every time when we conduct this kind of transformation, it was not the same.

244
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:59,140
All right, until Sunday. Dad. Right, so the system is dead, then we're going to change to another system.

245
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,360
That that we're going to do it again.

246
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,880
So that is the four faces.

247
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,990
So the process consists of four faces, right?

248
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:19,990
And each face consists of a series of stars, and we're going to document it.

249
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:25,840
So we have the proof, we have the documentation, we have the code, or that.

250
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:33,520
That's So it could be document or could be, you know, a deck of code that there whatever is.

251
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:36,840
It desirable, we call it desirable.

252
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:42,720
That's the product, the the product that we can't understand where we're we right?

253
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:47,400
So it should be rubable to be submits for review.

254
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,720
All right, to prove, OK, I approve.

255
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:51,040
You can go to the next one.

256
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,270
So this is about deliverable, right?

257
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:59,650
And phase are executed, usually sequentially, without planning.

258
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:01,250
You're not going to design, right?

259
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:04,890
That that's you are now going to design and then do the printing.

260
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:11,440
That's That means that we ask a sequential way, scrituling in order, right?

261
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:22,270
This and next and next are sequential incrementary, irresibly, or in some other, some other way?

262
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:31,240
I am here an answer to two words by incrementary, we understand spiritually incrementary it already.

263
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:34,380
What does it mean? I gave you the key words.

264
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:45,940
Really. It's a wedding. It's no one that's really is absent.

265
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:52,170
But restaurants, it's great. Please, please.

266
00:28:54,370 --> 00:29:03,170
Incrementary. What is incremental? Incremental incremental measurements.

267
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:06,730
Incremental increase, A decrease, more than of us.

268
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:14,490
Incrementally. Is it a value? Is it a value?

269
00:29:14,930 --> 00:29:21,160
Everybody? Yeah, I value. So we at Bye, bad morning.

270
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:24,260
So the morning by at value, incrementally.

271
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:30,010
This is ready. It ready. Incremental.

272
00:29:30,170 --> 00:29:44,830
Near weather. The right away, get right away is like, Repeat.

273
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:48,340
Repeat. What does it mean? Repeats year.

274
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:52,500
Um, it is a plan analysis, design and implementation.

275
00:29:52,660 --> 00:30:01,740
Tell me the weather submits it is I repeat?

276
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:04,490
What does means if I use this brand?

277
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:06,650
And as this design implementation, what does it mean?

278
00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:15,970
See, irritably, everyone can answer this.

279
00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:21,660
Irrelevant. Okay, kevin, I get pass the song.

280
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:25,510
It relatively

281
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:31,670
ully.

282
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:40,300
I mean, after a one run, you finish, I still see you may your sister may have some problem.

283
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:46,430
So you got the next round, and you will repeat it again again, so it is iterated

284
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:57,940
forever. Okay, good. Yeah, yeah. As I said, uh, we do it again again and again, while this one, a lot of wrongs like loop.

285
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:00,340
All right, why should rope? What the difference?

286
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:03,070
Not like a cold. I will call to you the same.

287
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:10,990
But you, you readily go to the previous phases by angle forward, and then so backward and forwards.

288
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:12,750
So we do this a couple of times.

289
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:23,040
Let me see it relatively. All right, so yeah, system design, you know, as alecutor in the secretary window, the secretary, right?

290
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:29,140
But we go back, all right, irrevery, and solve a problem and go to the next.

291
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:33,650
And then when we have some problems, we going to go back.

292
00:31:33,930 --> 00:31:44,050
That is only one track, but we can do it simultaneously, mother track, right, at the same time, right?

293
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:47,270
So you can see that's not just one track.

294
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:58,410
So well, I'm going to that, you know, that's, that's, you know, that's um planning.

295
00:31:58,670 --> 00:32:09,770
So we should initialize our idea and why do we need to have this system, or why do we need to have the change?

296
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:20,980
So you have a reason right to justify the reason initialize your thinking about the system design initialization.

297
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:27,330
You got to have a need right, probably from others' request, right?

298
00:32:27,490 --> 00:32:35,550
Then we need to understand, okay, well we initialize this thinking, is it possible to do that?

299
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:40,720
Here? Feasibility. Why is this feasible?

300
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:43,830
It is a doable when you come up the idea.

301
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:52,090
And then it's just feasible. Do we have enough money to do the project?

302
00:32:52,410 --> 00:32:56,390
We need to buy hardware subway, E.G.

303
00:32:56,550 --> 00:33:08,960
that? That's all right, okay. No pay for the, the, uh, the professional and other staff self is ability.

304
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:16,030
So at the beginning, we need to think that, do we have enough money budget to do that?

305
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:23,350
Right? And, well, what about our boss?

306
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:27,110
All right, what is supporters that has all this question?

307
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:30,720
Or, well, very important ones. Can we do that?

308
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:33,860
So, good. Think it is feasible.

309
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:40,710
And then through the its brain, it's a project initialization to this.

310
00:33:40,870 --> 00:33:45,090
very important. So we think that, um, it.

311
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:50,610
Yeah, it is worse doing that.

312
00:33:51,610 --> 00:33:53,410
And then so we can do it.

313
00:33:53,850 --> 00:33:58,050
It could be right or wrong if you do it right, right?

314
00:33:58,210 --> 00:34:08,700
So you do the writing and then try to make it, try to do it right, so do the right thing the 1st time and do it right.

315
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:17,550
If you have a wrong decision, no matter how wise you do, we turn out the wrong right.

316
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:20,210
So do the right thing the 1st time.

317
00:34:20,370 --> 00:34:30,190
I do it right. If you go to the wrong direction at the beginning, no matter how good you are, turn out to be fair.

318
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:36,190
Okay? The year project initialization is the most important phase.

319
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:46,700
Most important not to have correct, correct concept, correct direction, do the rise in the 1st time and do the right right.

320
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:51,940
So that's very, very important, right?

321
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:58,830
And then you're going to recruit the member and start the project, everything.

322
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:08,960
And you you want to know what should be included, what would you want to have?

323
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:12,090
So what means the function, right?

324
00:35:12,330 --> 00:35:26,320
So if that is feasible, it's a right way to do and you have enough preparation, then you know that what kind of function By sometimes you know it's going to do that.

325
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:29,000
At the same time, why not Really?

326
00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:29,150
That

327
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:34,930
you not. You have to finish all the plane, then analysis, we can do it at the same time.

328
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:35,590
So

329
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:39,050
you need to know what to be included, right?

330
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:45,060
So what to be included, analyze it, and then can we do it?

331
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:48,430
Well, that's hard, right? So design,

332
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:55,910
even though we know that, yeah, it is necessary to have business system and we get support.

333
00:35:56,410 --> 00:35:59,970
And your boss said that, still it, but it just cannot.

334
00:36:01,170 --> 00:36:06,410
So how come that you have a good idea, but, you know, generally cannot do it?

335
00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:10,070
So this one, you know, you wanted to, you know, make it realize that.

336
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:13,300
You realize that it's very, very difficult.

337
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:16,980
So it should be the the difficult one, right?

338
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:25,510
Design, you don't have the technique, you don't have the skill or know how, but you gotta know a lot of house that you can do it.

339
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:28,170
So that's a difficult, most difficult one.

340
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:33,420
And so until you have done all this, then implemented become easier.

341
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:37,150
All right, so implementation, I implement that.

342
00:36:37,310 --> 00:36:45,300
I give a good design and implement that, and to see what happened, uses feedback and correct them.

343
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:49,720
So this is about, um, the Earth deal.

344
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:55,920
See? All right, so, um, what just that on?

345
00:36:56,600 --> 00:37:11,390
I think you're already right. So, um, then I'm going to rich Face is the most important.

346
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:19,300
What? STOC Planning, right? Okay, good planning.

347
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:23,820
Yeah, we know that is the most difficult, most important one.

348
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:31,390
And a ring? Which? Which face you think that's the most difficult one?

349
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:48,610
A ring? Yeah, gentlemen. Alice again.

350
00:37:48,770 --> 00:37:57,280
Goods. It's Max, which this is a nervous, most difficult one.

351
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,700
Nurses. Yeah, is a difficult. Relax.

352
00:38:01,790 --> 00:38:05,850
Design. Yeah. Design. Okay, so analysis is difficult.

353
00:38:06,010 --> 00:38:08,970
We want to know this back.

354
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:12,520
All right. And, but this is not the most difficult one.

355
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:15,760
Even we know this back. You don't know how design it.

356
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:20,860
You got carrots, I am, right?

357
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:26,780
Codes. So, max. So yeah, um, analysis is is a heart.

358
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:33,620
But, um, yeah, we we need to have a programmer, right?

359
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:40,220
This program. And I just know how the program knows how to integrate the function, right?

360
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:42,400
So that's the most difficult one.

361
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:47,680
And, um, we just talk about feasibility.

362
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:51,580
So feasibility as in printing face.

363
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:55,560
So what aspects we need to take care about?

364
00:38:55,580 --> 00:39:00,580
His ability? Everyone is Jim like possibility.

365
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,780
Pass the microphone. Where is the microphone?

366
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:10,390
Feasibility? What is that about? Feasibility?

367
00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:18,350
Um, I think we need to consider about technical feasibility and economic and organizational.

368
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:23,380
Yeah, okay, it's pretty good. So I said that, can we do it?

369
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:26,970
Can we do We need to have the know how, right?

370
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:34,790
So technically, yeah, we can do it, but sometimes you can do it, but you don't have the support right organization, right?

371
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:37,670
There is quite important. And do you have the money or budgets?

372
00:39:37,830 --> 00:39:41,850
Right? So, yeah, yeah, that's very, very important.

373
00:39:42,270 --> 00:39:51,270
Not like you a graduate project, you graduate, probably because you you probably have no budgets, but you need to do it right?

374
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:55,070
So that is quite different. I-I said, it's a real, real project.

375
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:57,390
You need to have a budget to support, right?

376
00:39:57,550 --> 00:40:02,650
Salary, right? Well, it's a lot of things that, yeah, peace about this study.

377
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:07,690
Okay, yeah, that's good. Um, yeah.

378
00:40:10,410 --> 00:40:15,150
Dense. Um, methodology. I said, that's, we copy st O-C This the 1st issue.

379
00:40:15,210 --> 00:40:20,240
I said, that's, um, I'm going to focus on SDLC right?

380
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:28,500
Part of that I-I didn't, um, go to very detail, but read the textbook.

381
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:31,340
All right. The 2nd one is quite difficult.

382
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:37,710
It's the methodology, right? We also, we'll talk about this issue next week.

383
00:40:37,890 --> 00:40:38,010
All right.

384
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:40,310
It's on different textbook

385
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:42,870
records. This book. Chapter two.

386
00:40:42,950 --> 00:40:46,190
One. Chapter two. Yeah. Chapter two, yeah.

387
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:49,730
So we talk about the methodology

388
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:58,150
and process. So here, uh, we can categorize that it's a

389
00:40:58,510 --> 00:41:02,650
process oriented, data oriented, after oriented.

390
00:41:02,730 --> 00:41:11,570
For the three we go bits as one, processoriented, data oriented, after oriented.

391
00:41:11,830 --> 00:41:20,810
It says data center is the same oriented orientation, where orient to the process, mean focus on process.

392
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:26,330
All right, center, same student center, learner center.

393
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:30,450
Focus on the no focus songs, students, right?

394
00:41:30,610 --> 00:41:42,040
So you're the same, right? After, oriented to world up to we care about, after all, the meaning the same.

395
00:41:42,460 --> 00:42:12,350
Someone knows, process oriented. So I know that process oriented, data oriented, data centered on Some of you might learn this for Darwin, right?

396
00:42:12,910 --> 00:42:18,820
D FD Before this, for Darwin, evidence a data for that.

397
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:23,040
How much, how much you know, and how many of you understand?

398
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:26,220
Dear d that for seven? Lose your hand.

399
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:29,560
Let me know that. DVD No One.

400
00:42:29,960 --> 00:43:08,770
Little fruit one. I usually will buy cats D-D fruit album.

401
00:43:08,790 --> 00:43:10,990
Anyone knows that? Yeah, you do.

402
00:43:17,590 --> 00:43:21,740
Process, yeah. Process oriented. Yeah. I like to see that.

403
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:30,180
Yes. Okay, so process oriented is that?

404
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:34,440
Ah, you have to, you have to follow every step.

405
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:37,180
You have to come quickly every step.

406
00:43:37,310 --> 00:43:45,850
I like del C. Del C, like DB.

407
00:43:46,010 --> 00:43:51,730
You have to follow every like, analyse and implement something like that.

408
00:43:51,890 --> 00:44:04,170
You have to complete it. So you think our planning is a process, the processor, most of the spring is face.

409
00:44:04,730 --> 00:44:06,850
It is one of the process.

410
00:44:07,150 --> 00:44:10,230
One of the, the printing is one of the process.

411
00:44:10,390 --> 00:44:13,530
Yes, of of this is one of the process.

412
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:21,460
Supreme analysis, design, information, we have more adjustment.

413
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:25,740
So film planning is a kind of process.

414
00:44:26,110 --> 00:44:29,810
Is that that right? Process? Okay, yeah, we can.

415
00:44:30,150 --> 00:44:32,870
Yeah, planning on it's about face.

416
00:44:33,030 --> 00:44:35,510
How face going? Right? Screen sharing.

417
00:44:35,510 --> 00:44:43,360
But here he says, um, yeah, does this sequentiary, but the process ofiented?

418
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:52,980
Um, actually, this means that by process oriented, we regard process function.

419
00:44:54,100 --> 00:45:00,630
All right. We want to understand the function now in between.

420
00:45:00,870 --> 00:45:10,450
So year I sat as the the even though you saw this data, wanted to see how data goes and back, right?

421
00:45:10,630 --> 00:45:16,920
And from process, how process no goes.

422
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:23,660
E.G. Here we have this, we give it number, right?

423
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:43,890
E.G. this process one, we have, this is a data, data for data for from P one, perhaps because P too, right?

424
00:45:44,050 --> 00:45:46,730
The data for is a process.

425
00:45:47,450 --> 00:45:53,160
A process is a function. This function, outputs

426
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:55,190
become inputs

427
00:45:55,820 --> 00:45:58,120
another process. We

428
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:05,460
might have this diversion, the same data list.

429
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:06,350
Data will use none,

430
00:46:06,460 --> 00:46:16,840
right? And go to, yeah, you good for this?

431
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:24,700
Zero one, two brain. The one outs when output.

432
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:30,060
All right, they can debridge right to different process.

433
00:46:30,910 --> 00:46:39,030
And that's well, probably scum to data store.

434
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:48,040
All right, we save it. But this is not all because if you only say it, we all rethape it.

435
00:46:48,460 --> 00:46:52,800
See you. So let's so there will be data out right?

436
00:46:53,240 --> 00:47:06,270
Go to other process or go to different You can go to different process, or even go back.

437
00:47:06,530 --> 00:47:18,840
All right, E.G. the doubts though, will we focus right here?

438
00:47:18,950 --> 00:47:30,150
That's the process for space. If this is the oh, I-I should, sorry, I should use one, two, three, four, five.

439
00:47:30,310 --> 00:47:43,110
This easy. Two, three, four, five.

440
00:47:43,270 --> 00:47:45,910
And we had different data, right?

441
00:47:46,070 --> 00:47:58,200
I could go to a different data store, data store, but we focus on the process, how data flow, right?

442
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:01,940
This is going to different process.

443
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:11,440
And this way we also have them, uh, originator, right?

444
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:26,400
Yeah. This is the entity. We have entity, right?

445
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:32,490
It's going to pass the data to process, Right?

446
00:48:32,790 --> 00:48:35,990
So entity, you said your fruit.

447
00:48:36,150 --> 00:48:44,460
I want you going to see most of us process this external, external, right?

448
00:48:44,780 --> 00:48:51,540
This entity an ear. That's the process.

449
00:48:53,020 --> 00:48:58,730
All right, with great, probably wrong year.

450
00:48:59,030 --> 00:49:03,490
All right, go to other entity.

451
00:49:07,490 --> 00:49:13,280
Like think data it's going to provide to other entity.

452
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:20,350
So this is process oriented. It's a function we can drill down, right?

453
00:49:20,570 --> 00:49:23,110
That's one, that one, one, that two.

454
00:49:23,270 --> 00:49:32,300
Right? This one drilled until the terminal that will write code.

455
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:40,310
So that's the traditional one. Is a process oriented data the data center.

456
00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:46,670
Then we focus on the data, even though you can see data.

457
00:49:47,310 --> 00:49:50,910
But this is not data center, data center.

458
00:49:51,350 --> 00:50:21,550
Use entity relations. Darwin. You're going to see how interaction between entity, so reality, it could be Woo.

459
00:50:28,030 --> 00:50:40,790
Okay. Easier one. If we have to entertain anyone and teach you, of course, not just two many.

460
00:50:41,210 --> 00:50:43,670
So you're going to see one to one, right?

461
00:50:44,090 --> 00:50:46,310
One too many. Many to one.

462
00:50:46,590 --> 00:50:49,610
You understand that the best relationship.

463
00:50:49,770 --> 00:50:52,530
So we focus on that. So energy, you

464
00:50:52,690 --> 00:50:57,530
got the name. So you want this one, you have a name.

465
00:50:57,690 --> 00:50:58,430
if that students,

466
00:50:58,750 --> 00:51:01,270
right?

467
00:51:01,690 --> 00:51:09,020
An age, gender is based on what we need.

468
00:51:09,180 --> 00:51:09,630
All right,

469
00:51:10,030 --> 00:51:14,470
so this the attribute, the bus.

470
00:51:14,770 --> 00:51:20,710
It centered. Right? We want to see the interaction between the entity.

471
00:51:21,070 --> 00:51:25,460
It's one too many, many to one, or many too many, right?

472
00:51:26,260 --> 00:51:31,160
There is a data center. What about article?

473
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:40,730
Reentis actually oriented. All right, after oriented.

474
00:51:40,890 --> 00:51:59,710
Wanted to combine. So here we only see the the process, the step to drill down, if this is the function, um, make receipt or make payments, right?

475
00:52:01,310 --> 00:52:04,370
Retreat down, two, that one, two, that two, Two.

476
00:52:04,530 --> 00:52:06,710
Three. Or two. That one, that one.

477
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:18,590
Judo, right. Turn down. It's a process, but after alliented, we combined the process and data into one.

478
00:52:18,930 --> 00:52:27,460
So you're going to see the object right after has a name and attribute and behavior.

479
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:39,960
All right, so become three parts object name, attribute and behavior.

480
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:44,620
We can find that altogether after oriented.

481
00:52:44,620 --> 00:52:49,280
Then that's what I wanted to discuss and teach, right?

482
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:58,130
So after oriented, this is object oriented question for now.

483
00:52:59,830 --> 00:53:12,110
Kinds behind the schedule. I take minutes break.
